## Menu labels

A menu contains menu items that users use to navigate the pages of a control panel.

Consider the following guidelines when labeling menu items:

- Label menu items concisely and accurately.
- Avoid long lists of menu items. Limit the menu to no greater than seven menu items.
- Use groups to organize longer lists of menu items.
- Organize menu item groups logically.
- If possible, limit groups to five menu items. Seven is the upper limit of the number of menu items you can include in a group.
- If multiple groups have only one item, then rethink the menu item naming convention.
- When using groups, each menu item must belong to a group. Orphan menu items are not permitted.

## Content labels

Content labels are any labels on a page or a section of a page. Page titles, section titles, and subsection titles are examples of content labels.

When writing content labels, consider the following guidelines:

- Label content areas concisely. Use fewer words in a label to help the scannability of the content on a page.
- Write accurate labels that reflect the content the label introduces.
- Write descriptive labels. Descriptive labels communicate better with users than non-descriptive labels.
- Use parallel construction when labeling the sections of a control panel.
