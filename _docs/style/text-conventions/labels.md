  A label is a graphical control element that displays text on control panel page. Use a label to identify a text input control, navigation menu item, and tables rows and columns. A label can be interactive, as is the case with a button control, or static, like the name of a checkbox or radio button.

## Action labels

Use consistent labels across an action for a UI.

Refer to the following table when writing action labels:

{% figure [caption:"Action labels"] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
| Action label | Typical usage  |
| --- | --- |
| Create | Creates a new object. |
| Delete | Destroys an existing object. The label can include the object being deleted, such as Delete Image. |
| Download | Transfers a file to a user's local system. |
| Edit | Allows data or values to be modified. Edit does not imply the object is automatically updated. In most cases, you still must update in order for the change to occur. |
| Filter | Changes view to only include objects that match the filter criteria. |
| Import | Includes objects from an external source. |
| Manage | Modifies existing object settings or options. |
| Save | Saves data entered when you create an object. |
| Update | Automatically changes the data of an existing object. |
