## Write with active voice

Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the user) the subject of the sentence. Passive voice makes the recipient of the action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

Active-voice sentences are more engaging, less complicated, less wordy, and easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. With active voice, the actions and responses of the user are easier to distinguish from the actions and responses of the technology.

## Write clearly and objectively

Use the following guidelines to help you write clearly and objectively:

- Choose language that is clear and easy to understand. When possible, use fewer words. Every word should demonstrate value to the user.
- Help users avoid errors and roadblocks. Make sure content helps users recover quickly if those things happen.
- Alert users if they can't undo changes. Explain consequences and alternatives.
- Avoid non sequiturs, obscure references, or non-standard turns of phrase that might confuse or interrupt.
- Do not use humor, jargon, exclamation marks, idioms, metaphors, and other colloquialisms.
- Consider a user’s likely goal, desire, or state of mind. Anticipate confusion or frustration and respond appropriately.

## Use second person

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. You talk to users directly by using second person, addressing the user as you. Second person also promotes a friendly tone.

## Avoid abbreviations

Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, and slang. Use an abbreviation only if it is better known than the word that it stands for or if space savings is critical.

Unless an abbreviation is common, spell out the words of the abbreviation on the first use. Show the abbreviation in parentheses after the spelled-out term; for example, access control list (ACL). On subsequent uses, use the abbreviation. If you introduce an abbreviation, use it; don't alternate between the abbreviation and the spelled-out term.

## Maintain parallel construction

Use a parallel structure to present options. Don’t ask users to choose from unrelated values.
