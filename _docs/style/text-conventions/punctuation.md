## Periods

End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words. Put one space, not two, after a period.

Don’t use end punctuation in tooltips.

## Hyphens and dashes

Use the following rules for hyphens and dashes:

- Use hyphens (-) to create a single idea out of two or more words.
  - Don’t add a space before or after the hyphen.
- Use en dashes (–) for ranges, like numbers (such as, 1–9) and dates.
  - Don’t add a space before of after the en dash.
- Use em dashes (—), the longest dashes, to set off a long qualifier in the middle of a sentence if the use of commas would hinder readability.
  - Don’t add a space before of after the en dash.
  - Don’t capitalize the word following an em dash, unless the word is proper.
  - Don’t use an em dash to separate a long sentence into two parts. Instead, create two sentences.

## Ellipses

Consider the following best practices when you use ellipses:

- Use ellipses with Button or Menu components when the action requires additional user input, usually with a dialog, an alert, or a move to another window or part of the UI.
- Do not use an ellipsis in a link to indicate that more information is available at the destination.
- In general, do not use ellipses in body copy.
- **Best practice for truncating ellipses**

## Exclamation points

Avoid using use exclamation points. If you must use them, use them sparingly - when the text reflects genuine excitement, not as a way to create excitement.
