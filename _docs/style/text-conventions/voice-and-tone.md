The primary job of the words in a UI is to help users complete tasks with no
confusion and minimal interruption. However, the voice and tone that we use
with words in a UI also influence how people think and feel about Rackspace.

Voice is our style, and communicates our personality to the user. Tone is our mood,
and communicates our attitude about the subject to the user.

The words we choose — and the ways we use them — should reflect our goals: building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and developing a relationship with Rackspace users.

## Best practices - no table

Consider the following voice and tone best practices when you write user interface text:

#### Write in a way that the user wants to be spoken to. Use helpful words and phrases that are informative, simple, clear and easy to understand.

- Use: The IP address of the server still needs to be entered. Click the My Server button to complete the configuration.
- Don't use: The monitoring engine couldn't connect to the server. Make sure the information is correctly entered.
<br>
<br>

#### Temper the enthusiasm conveyed in confirmation messages.

- Use: You have successfully configured databases for monitoring.
- Don't use: Congratulations!! ALL of your databases are now being monitored!!
<br>
<br>

#### Be careful about laying blame. Don't take the blame for a negative situation. Don't lay the blame of the negative situation on the user.

- Use: The system could not validate your account. Please enter your credentials again.
- Don't use: Either you didn't enter your credentials correctly, or the system timed out. Please enter your credentials again.
<br>
<br>

#### In positive situations, be encouraging and offer next steps. Don't take credit for the user's success.

- Use: Configuration successful. You can now commission and decommission servers on-demand..
- Don't use: Congrats! Our system is so easy to use that you are now able to commission and decommission servers on-demand.
<br>
<br>

#### In negative situations, be clear about the problem and how the user can fix it. Don't ask the user to trust us without providing more information.

- Use: Your account details and database IP address range don't match. Ensure that the IP addresses on the Account Details page are correct.
- Don't use: The database configuration failed.
<br>
