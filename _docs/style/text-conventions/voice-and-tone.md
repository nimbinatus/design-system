The primary job of the words in a UI is to help users complete tasks with no
confusion and minimal interruption. However, the voice and tone that we use
with words in a UI also influence how people think and feel about Rackspace.

Voice is our style, our point of view, and our personality. Tone is our
attitude and how we are perceived by those who read (and hear) our words. Voice
determines how we write. Tone determines our attitude to the subject and
audience, and how we're perceived by our audience.

The words we choose — and the ways we use them — should reflect our goals: building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and developing a relationship with Rackspace users.

When you write in-product instructions and descriptions, use words that reflect the following voice and tone attributes:

{% figure [caption:"Basic voice and tone attributes"] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
| Voice attributes | Tone attributes  |
| --- | --- |
| Trustworthy | Helpful |
| Knowledgeable | Approachable |
| Friendly | Accurate |
| Confident | Professional |
| Human | Indespensible |
| Conversational | Honest |
|  | Smart |

{% endfigure %}

To emphasize the text you are writing, use words that reflect the following amplified voice and tone attributes:

{% figure [caption:"Amplified voice and tone attributes"] [class:"image bg-light border"] %}
| Voice attributes | Tone attributes  |
| --- | --- |
| Bold | Empathetic without sugarcoating it |
| Voice of reality | Empowering and proactive |
| Voice of experience | Playful, but professional |
| Committed | Steadfast, but open and approachable |
| Exuberant |  |
