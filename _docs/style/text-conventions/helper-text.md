  On-page instructions and descriptions is any text that appears in a Control Panel that helps the user understand what a feature is or how to complete a task. On-page instructions and descriptions can include welcome text for a new feature, text that describes procedural steps, and field-level help text that appears in tooltips. On-page instructions and description can be displayed on the page persistently, or can be displayed when the user hovers over a UI element.

## Writing guidelines

This section includes guidelines for you to follow when you write on-page text for a Control Panel.

### Avoid abbreviations

Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, and slang. Use an abbreviation only if it is better known than the word that it stands for or if space savings is critical.

Unless an abbreviation is common, spell out the words of the abbreviation on the first use. Show the abbreviation in parentheses after the spelled-out term; for example, access control list (ACL). On subsequent uses, use the abbreviation. If you introduce an abbreviation, use it; don't alternate between the abbreviation and the spelled-out term.

### Write with active voice

Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the user) the subject of the sentence. Passive voice makes the recipient of the action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

Active-voice sentences are more engaging, less complicated, less wordy, and easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. With active voice, the actions and responses of the user are easier to distinguish from the actions and responses of the technology.

### Write clearly and objectively

Use the following guidelines to help you write clearly and objectively:

- Choose language that is clear and easy to understand. When possible, use fewer words. Every word should demonstrate value to the user.
- Help users avoid errors and roadblocks. Make sure content helps users recover quickly if those things happen.
- Alert users if they can't undo changes.
- Avoid non sequiturs, obscure references, or non-standard turns of phrase that might confuse or interrupt.
- Do not use humor, jargon, exclamation marks, idioms, metaphors, and other colloquialisms.

### Use second person

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. You talk to users directly by using second person, addressing the user as you. Second person also promotes a friendly tone.

## Voice and tone

The primary job of the words in a UI is to help users complete tasks with no
confusion and minimal interruption. However, the voice and tone that we use
with words in a UI also influence how people think and feel about Rackspace.

Voice is our style, our point of view, and our personality. Tone is our
attitude and how we are perceived by those who read (and hear) our words. Voice
determines how we write. Tone determines our attitude to the subject and
audience, and how we're perceived by our audience.

The words we choose — and the ways we use them — should reflect our goals:
building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and developing a
relationship with Rackspace users.

| Voice attributes | Tone attributes  |
| --- | --- |
| xxxx | xxxx |
| xxxx | xxxx |
| xxxx | xxxx |

## Capitalization

In general, use sentence-style capitalization when you write helper text and other in-product text and descriptions.

For sentence-style capitalization, most words are lowercase, with the following exceptions.

- Capitalize only the first word of the text element.
- Capitalize any other words that you would normally capitalize, such as proper nouns.

## Punctuation

Using punctuation consistently throughout a UI maintains a user-friendly and professional look.

### Apostrophes and quotation marks

Use the typographic characters (also called smart quotes, or curly quotes) for apostrophes and quotation marks.

### Commas

Use serial commas (also called Oxford commas).

### Hyphens and dashes

Use the following rules for hyphens and dashes:

- Use hyphens (-) to create a single idea out of two or more words.
  - Don’t add a space before or after the hyphen.
- Use en dashes (–) for ranges, like numbers (such as, 1–9) and dates.
  - Don’t add a space before of after the en dash.
- Use em dashes (—), the longest dashes, to set off a long qualifier in the middle of a sentence if the use of commas would hinder readability.
  - Don’t add a space before of after the en dash.
  - Don’t capitalize the word following an em dash, unless the word is proper.
  - Don’t use an em dash to separate a long sentence into two parts. Instead, create two sentences.

### Ellipses

Use ellipses with Button or Menu components when the action requires additional user input, usually with a dialog, an alert, or a move to another window or part of the UI.

Do not use an ellipsis in a link to indicate that more information is available at the destination.

In general, do not use ellipses in body copy.

### Exclamation points

Avoid using use exclamation points. If you must use them, use them sparingly - when the text reflects genuine excitement, not as a way to create excitement.

### Periods

End all sentences with a period, even if they're only two words. Put one space, not two, after a period.

Don’t use end punctuation in tooltips.
