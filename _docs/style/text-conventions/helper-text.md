### Avoid abbreviations

Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, and slang. Use an abbreviation only if it is better known than the word that it stands for or if space savings is critical.

Unless an abbreviation is common, spell out the words of the abbreviation on the first use. Show the abbreviation in parentheses after the spelled-out term; for example, access control list (ACL). On subsequent uses, use the abbreviation. If you introduce an abbreviation, use it; don't alternate between the abbreviation and the spelled-out term.

### Write with active voice

Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the user) the subject of the sentence. Passive voice makes the recipient of the action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

Active-voice sentences are more engaging, less complicated, less wordy, and easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. With active voice, the actions and responses of the user are easier to distinguish from the actions and responses of the technology.

| Use (active) | Avoid (passive) |

| Click **OK** to save the configuration. | The configuration is saved when the **OK** button is clicked. |

### Write clearly and objectively

Use the following guidelines to help you write clearly and objectively:

- Choose language that is clear and easy to understand. When possible, use fewer words. Every word should demonstrate value to the user.
- Help users avoid errors and roadblocks. Make sure content helps users recover quickly if those things happen.
- Alert users if they can't undo changes.
- Avoid non sequiturs, obscure references, or non-standard turns of phrase that might confuse or interrupt.
- Do not use humor, jargon, exclamation marks, idioms, metaphors, and other colloquialisms.

### Use second person

Users are more engaged with content when it talks to them directly. You talk to users directly by using second person, addressing the user as you. Second person also promotes a friendly tone.

## Voice and tone

The primary job of the words in a UI is to help users complete tasks with no
confusion and minimal interruption. However, the voice and tone that we use
with words in a UI also influence how people think and feel about Rackspace.

Voice is our style, our point of view, and our personality. Tone is our
attitude and how we are perceived by those who read (and hear) our words. Voice
determines how we write. Tone determines our attitude to the subject and
audience, and how we're perceived by our audience.

The words we choose — and the ways we use them — should reflect our goals:
building trust, inspiring confidence, making things easier, and developing a
relationship with Rackspace users.

| Voice attributes | Tone attributes  |
| --- | --- |
| xxxx | xxxx |
| xxxx | xxxx |
| xxxx | xxxx |

## Capitalization

In general, use sentence-style capitalization when you write helper text and other in-product text and descriptions.

For sentence-style capitalization, most words are lowercase, with the following exceptions.

- Capitalize only the first word of the text element.
- Capitalize any other words that you would normally capitalize, such as proper nouns.
