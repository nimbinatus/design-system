### Avoid abbreviations

Avoid abbreviations, acronyms, and slang. Use an abbreviation only if it is better known than the word that it stands for or if space savings is critical.

Unless an abbreviation is common, spell out the words of the abbreviation on the first use. Show the abbreviation in parentheses after the spelled-out term; for example, access control list (ACL). On subsequent uses, use the abbreviation. If you introduce an abbreviation, use it; don't alternate between the abbreviation and the spelled-out term.

### Write with active voice

Active voice makes the performer of the action (usually the user) the subject of the sentence. Passive voice makes the recipient of the action (not the performer) the subject of the sentence.

Active-voice sentences are more engaging, less complicated, less wordy, and easier to understand than passive-voice sentences. With active voice, the actions and responses of the user are easier to distinguish from the actions and responses of the technology.
